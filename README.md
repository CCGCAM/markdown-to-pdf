# Markdown to PDF

*On demand generation of enterprise-grade PDFs from GitHub-hosted markdown files*

## Huh? You're just trollin', right?

Not at all. Markdown may be the *linga franca* for software and other technical documentation, but many suit-and-tie wearing CIO-types won't take information seriously unless it's presented as a PDF or PowerPoint deck.

With this app you can send them a link to a crisp, clean, "enterprise-grade" PDF, transparently generated on demand from a standard markdown file hosted on GitHub.com.

## Usage

Simply swap `github.com` for your instance's hostname in the path to the blob view of any markdown file on GitHub.com.

## Running locally

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec rackup`
